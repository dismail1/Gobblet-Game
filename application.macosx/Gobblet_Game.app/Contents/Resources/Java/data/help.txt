Gobblet Rules

The playing area is a board with 16 
cells.There are 24 playing pieces 
called "gobblets", 12 of each color 
for 2 players. There are gobblets of 
4 sizes, so each player has 3 big, 3 
medium, 3 small and 3 mini gobblets.

Each player takes turns either placing 
a gobblet on the board, moving a 
gobblet to a new position on the board, 
or "gobble" a smaller piece.
Players can gobble either their 
opponent's or their own gobblets.

The first player to build a horizontal, 
vertial or diagonal line of 4 gobblets 
is the winner!
